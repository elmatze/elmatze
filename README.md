- 👋 Hi, I’m @elmatze
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, but I am quite garbage :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basic 3 languages for web development together with Vue.js.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects with Simon 🤙🏽
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't know, is my E-Mail public?

- ⚡ Fun fact: Yes, I did use the default description. Since it's obligatory (for the student developer pack), I finished my task efficiently (as always 😎).
